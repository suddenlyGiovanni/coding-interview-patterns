> “We’re a tiny company that manufactures parts for other companies: widgets, gizmos, and the like. We’ve been growing quite fast, and our current processes are not able to keep up. Right now, everything we do is paper-based, and we’d like to computerize all that so that our staff can handle larger volumes of orders. In particular, we’d like to have a self-service website so that customers can do some tasks themselves. Things like placing an order, checking order status, and so on.”
